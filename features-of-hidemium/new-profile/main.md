### Timezone

This feature is the default, and you should follow Hidemium form because Timezone is based on the IP address or proxy you are using, which guarantees for browser profile. Besides, you can still manually enter the desired time zone without relying on the IP address or proxy.

* Timezone based on the external IP: You should leave this feature as default since Timezone will be based on IP address or proxy address, SOCKS that you are using. This will be best with the browser.
* Fill geolocation based on the external IP: This feature allows you to choose the timezone you want without relying on ip address, proxy, socks.
