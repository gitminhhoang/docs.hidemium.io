# PROXIES

Hidemium is more convenient when developing a batch proxy management tool.

Once you have entered the list of proxies, you can return to the Profiles section to select the Profile you want to add a proxy to (as introduced in the New Profile > Proxy section above).

Besides, Hidemium also supports downloading the proxy list on the software with the Export feature in the Proxies section.
